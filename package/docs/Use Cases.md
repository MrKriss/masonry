# An Example Usecase

Some of the projects I work on tend to evolve a bit over time, starting out as a short scripted proof of concept pieces before later structuring as a Python package, adding unit tests and logging, adding build files and docker files etc. Doing all of this up front seems a bit overkill, especially as not all proof of concepts make it that far.
